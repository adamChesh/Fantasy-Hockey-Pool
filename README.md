# Adam's 2020/21 Hockey Fantasy Pool Manager

## What I propose to design this term:

This application will create a hockey fantasy pool. It will consist of players with their statistics attached to 
them and fantasy teams for the players to be added to. As many players and teams as youâ€™d like can be added to the 
pool.Once added you will be able to view the leaderboard and view all the teams with the players. This application will 
be useful to track players in fantasy hockey and to see how good certain players are depending on how the points are 
allocated between goals, assists and penalty minutes. This project is of interest to me because I am an avid fantasy 
hockey player and I like to keep track of what players are good for different types of leagues.
